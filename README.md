I have been passionate about video games for as long as I can remember, with a deep interest in their history, the technologies behind them, and their evolution in the market.
After more than 10 years of exploring the gaming universe as a player, I am now determined to transition from consumer to industry contributor.

Over the years, I have experienced hundreds of games across various genres, including Fallout 4, Civilization VI, Valorant, Enter the Gungeon, Mass Effect, and the Assassinâ€™s Creed series.

This wide-ranging experience has given me a keen eye for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different genres while aligning them with the typical player profiles they attract. Creative and curious,
I strive to understand market needs and craft innovative solutions to meet them. ðŸš€
